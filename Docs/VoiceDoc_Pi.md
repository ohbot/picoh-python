# Web Speech

Picoh supports Google Web speech using [gTTS](https://github.com/pndurette/gTTS). This provides a more realistic voice and support for multiple languages on the Raspberry Pi. Please note that using this speech means the text Picoh says is processed online on Google's servers. 

The language can be changed by calling picoh.setLanguage() passing a string containing a [google language code](https://cloud.google.com/speech-to-text/docs/languages).

For example:

```python
picoh.setLanguage("da-DK")
```
or
```python
picoh.setLanguage("en-GB")
```
or
```python
picoh.setLanguage("en-US")
```
